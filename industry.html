        <h2>About the Industry</h2>
        <p>
            I work in the <strong>Media Production & AI Video Software</strong> industry. 
            Our company, <em>PrimeTime Editz</em>, focuses on producing and enhancing sports video content 
            through artificial intelligence and high-end video editing. 
            We collaborate with major sports networks such as ESPN to create professional highlight reels, 
            athlete interviews, and feature films that capture the excitement of live sports 
            while maintaining broadcast quality.
        </p>

        <h2>My Role in the Organization</h2>
        <p>
            As the <strong>Chief Financial Officer (CFO)</strong> and Management Lead, 
            I oversee the company’s finances, budgets, and operational planning. 
            I handle strategic investments in new technology such as GPUs, RAID storage, and editing software, 
            while ensuring that our spending supports long-term growth and innovation.
        </p>

        <h2>Ethical Issue</h2>
        <p>
            An ethical issue that may arise in my position is the responsible use of AI-generated media. 
            It’s crucial that all AI tools we use follow ethical standards to avoid creating misleading content 
            or misusing someone’s image or likeness without consent.
        </p>

        <h2>Cybersecurity Issues</h2>
        <p>
            1. <strong>Unauthorized Access:</strong> Sensitive video footage, financial data, and client information could be targeted 
            by hackers if systems are not properly secured.<br>
            2. <strong>Ransomware Attacks:</strong> Our large video files and project databases could be encrypted by ransomware, 
            halting production and causing major financial losses.
        </p>

        <h2>Cybersecurity Best Practices</h2>
        <p>
            To protect our business, we enforce cybersecurity best practices such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Using multi-factor authentication and strong passwords.</li>
            <li>Encrypting client data and video files during storage and transfer.</li>
            <li>Conducting regular software updates and network security audits.</li>
            <li>Training employees on phishing and safe data handling procedures.</li>
        </ul>
